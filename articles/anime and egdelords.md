now me personally im not exactly into anime. there are some good ones yeah but when i started i was like "it can't be that bad right?"

yeah no, there is a lot of pedo shit. and that's from **big** known anime titles like wtf?

anyway, the main topic i wanted to get on was [edgelords](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=edgelord). ![emoji](../media/emojis/joedead.webp)

what's with people in posting 9/11 "meme" videos? it's not even a meme since it's not funny. plus there is a bunch of wannabe nazis saying "oh oh he's the best man i hate ###s!"

i haven't met a single person who is unironically racist though so that's good. but why do some people try to convince us into thinking they are racist when they aren't? it's usually just a phase in their life too.

i just find 9/11 and 1939-1945 memes (you know what i mean) cringe. also i just saw a concentration camp parody video today like wtf? god we live in a society where lots of edgelords actually think they are cool.
