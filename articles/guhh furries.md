ok now me personally im fine with the way furries work.

it's just a bunch of people doing an animal cosplay which is fine.

pretty cool until you see the **known** side of the community.

it's now an entire thing for pedophiles to target un-suspecting people wanting to be furries.

and then like *almost every* pedophile was like "yoo lets gooooo people to harass" which is why the furry community is genuinely garbage.

their community is now full of weirdos that are either future pedos or currently pedos.

my friend (who is now a furry) always gets mad at me when we game on garry's mod, only because i say "oh shit a furry, hunt him down!" since he has a furry player model. like dude, im forced to interact with the extremely weird ones on a daily basis.

it doesn't matter if he's a rare normal one, it feels like a damn jumpscare.

all im saying is lots of furries these days are seriously messed up in the head. ![emoji](../media/emojis/joepc.gif)

i feel like i should've used ChatGPT atleast once to see if anything i said makes sense.
