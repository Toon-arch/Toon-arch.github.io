my friend sent me a video of a guy ([trans mtf](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mtf)) that was basically talking about his girl voice training.

he was all like "oh so i've been practicing" and stuff but then at the end he said "rate it in the comments"

it appears he was "doing" one during the entire video. bro it's so masculine it doesn't even pass as a high voice and every mf is like "you go girl!! slay!!!"

idk why i made this
